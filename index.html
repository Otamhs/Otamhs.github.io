            <p>Welcome to Critical Forging! On this site you will find our information for placing an order with us or
                looking into requesting a custom order.
                all the details can be found throughout the site and contact info can be found below. Please keep in
                mind that blacksmithing is an involved effort
                and takes time to complete. Custom orders even more so. Your patience is appreciate while you are
                waiting on your order.
            </p>

                <dd>Critical Forging is a one man blacksmith forge operated by yours truly.</dd>
                <dt><b>How long can my order be expected to take?</b></dt>
                <dd>At this time it is likely to take at least a month, and likely longer. As I am still learning and
                    working towards
                    my ABS (American BladeSmith Society) Journeyman I want to ensure the quality of my product and make
                    sure you
                    are not receiving an inferior product.
                </dd>
                <dt><b>How long have you been at this?</b></dt>
                <dd>At this time only a few months but I am enjoying everything I do and am steadily working towards
                    making more orders
                    and incresing order capacity of what can be filled and shipped in a reasonable amount of time.
